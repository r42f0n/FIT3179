Introduction
In this assignment, you will design   and   build   an   effective   data visualization   for   a   specific domain. This will   require you to critically evaluate   information   in   a   domain   of your   choice,   develop your own visualization, and tell   a   story. The   domain   can   be   broad   or   specific, depending on the availability of   datasets   and your   interests.The aim of the assignment   is to   apply the   data   visualization   methods   and   techniques   discussed during the first six weeks   of the   semester   and   demonstrate their   use   in   an      innovative context. As such, the visualization should   satisfy   the   following   criteria:
●       Why? The visualization addresses   a   particular   need   within   a   specific   domain   of
your choosing.   It   must   be targeted to   users with specific   information   needs   in this   domain or   be   useful and   relevant to   individuals   interested   in the chosen   domain.
●       What?   It visualises   data   relevant to the   domain.   Data   can   be   of   any   kind.
●       Who?   Design your visualisation for the   average   Australian   or   Malaysian,
depending on whether you are a   student   at   the   Clayton   or   Malaysia   campus.
●       The visualisation   must transform. data   into   meaningful   information   and   provide   insight that would otherwise   be difficult or   impossible   to   obtain   without   it.
●       It   must   provide   an   appropriate   level   of   interactive   exploration.
●       It   needs to   show   some   innovation.   While   it   does   not   have   to   be   wholly   original,   it   cannot   be a   replica of an existing   visualisation.   It   could   include   an   innovative visualisation   idiom, or an   innovative exploration of   an   interesting   dataset.
●       Your submission   must demonstrate   the   use   of the   Five   Design   Sheet   methodology   for sketching and   planning the design   of your visualisation.
●       Your submission   must demonstrate   the   use   of   Munzer’s   What/Why/How   framework discussed   in   lectures.
●       It   must apply   design   principles   discussed   throughout   the   unit,   such   as   data-ink      ratio, storytelling,   layout, typography and visualisation   idioms with   appropriate   use of   marks   and   channels.
Task   Description
1.       Choose   a domain   that   you   would   like   to   explore.
2.         Find   relevant data that   is   publicly   available.
3.       Prepare a   proposal   with   a   summary   of   your   domain,   dataset,   and   possible   design   ideas and submit   it to   Moodle   by the end   of Week   2.   Present   your   proposal   to your tutor   in the Week 3 studio to   obtain   approval. You   may   amend   your   proposal after discussion with your tutor,   and the   proposal   will   serve   as   a   record of what   has   been agreed   upon. The approval and   proposal   are   not   graded   but   are   a   hurdle   requirement for this assignment: you   must obtain formal   approval from      your tutor   before submitting the   report.
4.       Design a   narrative   visualisation   using   the   Five   Design   Sheet   Methodology   using analogue   pen and   paper代 写FIT3179 Data Visualisation 1 Semester 2, 2024Haskell
代做程序编程语言. Sketches designed with tablet   apps   or   other   digital   tools   are   not accepted.   By the end of week 4,   submit   your   Five   Design   Sheets,   and   discuss them with your tutor   in the week   5 studio.   Failure   to   do   so   will   result   in   0   marks for the five   design   sheets.
5.       Implement your   design with   Tableau   and   publish   the   visualisation   on   the   Tableau   Public server.
6.       Submit   the   following   on   Moodle:
a.       The   public   URL   to your   visualisation
b.       Information about   your   visualisation   via   a   form   on   Moodle:
i.       The   domain,the   why   and   the   who   of   the   visualisation.
ii.       What: The data   (sources, authors,   relevance,   creation   process,   etc.).
iii.       How: Give   a   rationale   for   choosing   the   specific   idioms   and   explain   how they   help   users to achieve their tasks.   Describe any   special features of your visualisation, such as   custom-built   elements.
Expectations
Data: The visualization   must   use accurate and   reliable   real-world data;   it   must   not   use
fabricated or tampered data. The   most   recent available   dataset   should   be   used.   Kaggle datasets   must   be combined with an additional   source.   Use   existing   and   reasonably   clean   data; creating datasets or   performing data   wrangling   are   not   topics   covered   in   this   unit and are   not   included   in the   marking   rubric.
Topic: The following visualization topics are   not allowed: World   happiness,   COVID-19,   Airbnb,   crime   in Victoria,   road accidents   in Victoria, data science   salaries,   house   prices   in   Melbourne,   university   rankings, car sales, and electric   vehicle   sales.   In   general, the   topic   must   be   related   to Australia   (for students   in Australia) or   Malaysia   (for students   in   Malaysia).   For   example, tobacco consumption   in the   US   is   not an acceptable topic,   but tobacco   consumption   in   Australia or   Malaysia   is acceptable.   Exceptions are   possible,   particularly   if you   have a   specific   area of   interest.   If   in doubt, discuss your topic   with   your   tutor.
Format: The entire visualization   must   be accessible from a   single   URL   on   the   Tableau   Public server.   It   must   be viewable on a   single   web   page that   can   be   scrolled,   and   the   full   width of the visualization   must   be visible on a   small   laptop   screen   without   horizontal   scrolling. There should   be   no   buttons   (or other weblinks) that swap   major   sections   of the   web   page, though you   may   use   buttons to show and   hide visualization   elements.
Presentation   not exploration: The goal of this assignment   is to   create   a   visualisation   that   communicates   interesting   information   in an easily accessible and   graphically   engaging way   using storytelling elements,   layout   principles, typography, and graphical   design.   The   goal   is   not to create an expert tool   for   exploring   and   analysing   a   dataset.
Audience: The topic   must   be   relevant to and easily   understandable   by an   audience   in Malaysia   (for students   in   Malaysia) or Australia   (for students   in Australia). Avoid jargon and technical terms when   possible.   If specialized terminology   is   necessary,   introduce and   explain these terms. Avoid visualizations that   require   knowledge of statistics   (e.g.,   understanding standard deviation or confidence   intervals),   as   the   general   audience   is   not   expected to   have such expertise.   If statistical concepts   are   necessary,   introduce   and   explain them.
Quality,   not quantity: Your visualization will   likely contain   between three   and ten   charts   or diagrams. There   is   no set   minimum or   maximum   number   of charts.   Instead,   we   are   looking for carefully designed and   annotated   charts that,   in   combination   with   text,   icons,   and   pictures, guide the   user through an   interesting story   using   layout   principles,   typography, and graphic design   principles. Avoid   pixelated   images,   non-informative   graphical elements, or trivial text. Complement your   visualization   with   concise,   informative, and grammatically correct   narrative text that tells   a   story.
Interactivity:   Interactive features are easy to add   in Tableau.   Integrate   interactivity   where   it   makes sense,   but avoid adding   interactive elements   merely   for   their   own   sake.
